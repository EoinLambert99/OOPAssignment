## OOP Assignment - sci-fi HUD

### Description:
I created an assignment for a Sci-Fi HUD.
I first drew inspiration from looking up pictures of Sci-Fi Huds on Google just to 
get a better understanding of what I had to do. I came across a lot of pictures of spaceships with different data represented on them. After more research I decided to add some features based on the Star Wars Fighter pilot with the octagon on the window.
One of the biggest part of the program was the star field, this was a very difficult aspect of the assignment and I looked up videos and tutorials on how to implement this.
I also added a radar in the bottom of the screen and I was able to code this as we had covered it in class

### Instructions: 
use the 'UP' and 'DOWN' keys to increase the speed of the stars flying past the ship, this creates the illusion of a space-warp. These Keys also increase or decrease the barcharts.
When you click on the window in the sketch it shoots a bullet out to where the mouse was pointing to. If you click on the circle under the window it changes the colour o the window to the colour that is in the sqaure underneath it which changes everytime there is a mouse click.
